## Comparison of Geometry Calibration Methods
- To run the geometry calibration using iterative data set matching [1] run
the following command:
```bash 
$ python -m paderwasn.experiments.calibration_method with 'iter_dsm'
``` 
- To run the geometry calibration using iterative data set matching [1] without 
weighting and fitness selection run the following command:
```bash 
$ python -m paderwasn.experiments.calibration_method with 'iter_dsm_simple'
``` 
- To run the GARDE-algorithm [2] run the following command:
```bash 
$ python -m paderwasn.experiments.calibration_method with 'garde'
```
